# HTTPS CORS Fix - Complete Solution

## üö® Problem Description
You're experiencing CORS errors when accessing your application via HTTPS, but it works fine with HTTP. This is a common issue that occurs due to several factors:

1. **Browser Security**: Modern browsers are more strict about CORS when using HTTPS
2. **Origin Header Handling**: HTTPS requests require proper origin header handling
3. **CORS Configuration**: Basic CORS configs may not handle HTTPS properly

## üîß What I've Fixed

### 1. Enhanced CorsConfig.java
- ‚úÖ Changed from `allowedOrigins("*")` to `allowedOriginPatterns()` for better HTTPS support
- ‚úÖ Added specific patterns for HTTP and HTTPS origins
- ‚úÖ Improved exposed headers configuration
- ‚úÖ Added dual-layer CORS support (WebMvc + Filter)

### 2. New CorsFilter.java
- ‚úÖ High-priority filter that runs before all other components
- ‚úÖ Dynamically sets `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` based on request origin
- ‚úÖ Properly handles preflight OPTIONS requests
- ‚úÖ Ensures CORS headers are set for all requests

### 3. Updated application.yml
- ‚úÖ Added HTTPS configuration options
- ‚úÖ Server-level CORS settings

## üöÄ How to Deploy the Fix

### Step 1: Build the Application
```bash
./mvnw clean package -DskipTests
```

### Step 2: Deploy the New JAR
```bash
# Stop the current application
# Copy the new JAR file to your server
# Start the application with the new JAR
```

### Step 3: Test CORS
```bash
# Use the provided test script
./test-cors.sh

# Or test manually
curl -v -H "Origin: https://yourdomain.com" \
     "http://localhost:8080/api/cors-test/simple"
```

## üîç Why This Fixes HTTPS CORS

### Before (Problematic):
```java
.allowedOrigins("*")  // ‚ùå Doesn't work well with HTTPS
```

### After (Fixed):
```java
.allowedOriginPatterns(
    "http://*", 
    "https://*", 
    "http://localhost:*", 
    "https://localhost:*"
)  // ‚úÖ Properly handles both HTTP and HTTPS
```

### Dynamic Origin Handling:
```java
// In CorsFilter.java
String origin = request.getHeader("Origin");
if (origin != null) {
    response.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", origin);  // ‚úÖ Echoes back the actual origin
} else {
    response.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");    // ‚úÖ Fallback for no origin
}
```

## üß™ Testing Your Fix

### 1. Test HTTP (Should Work):
```bash
curl -H "Origin: http://localhost:3000" \
     "http://localhost:8080/api/cors-test/simple"
```

### 2. Test HTTPS (Should Now Work):
```bash
curl -H "Origin: https://localhost:3000" \
     "http://localhost:8080/api/cors-test/simple"
```

### 3. Test Preflight (Should Work):
```bash
curl -X OPTIONS \
     -H "Origin: https://example.com" \
     -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: POST" \
     "http://localhost:8080/api/cors-test/preflight"
```

## üîß If HTTPS Still Doesn't Work

### Check These Points:

1. **Application Deployment**: Ensure you're running the NEW version with these CORS fixes
2. **Traefik Configuration**: Verify Traefik is not stripping CORS headers
3. **HTTPS Endpoint**: Confirm your HTTPS endpoint is actually accessible
4. **Browser Console**: Check for specific error messages

### Common Traefik Issues:
```yaml
# In your Traefik configuration, ensure CORS headers are preserved
middleware:
  cors:
    headers:
      accessControlAllowOriginList:
        - "*"
      accessControlAllowMethods:
        - "GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,OPTIONS"
      accessControlAllowHeaders:
        - "*"
```

## üìã Verification Checklist

- [ ] Application built with new CORS configuration
- [ ] New JAR deployed to server
- [ ] Application restarted
- [ ] HTTP requests work (baseline)
- [ ] HTTPS requests now work (fix verification)
- [ ] Preflight OPTIONS requests work
- [ ] Swagger UI loads without CORS errors
- [ ] All API endpoints accessible via HTTPS

## üéØ Expected Results

After deploying this fix:
- ‚úÖ HTTPS requests will work without CORS errors
- ‚úÖ HTTP requests will continue to work
- ‚úÖ Preflight requests will be handled properly
- ‚úÖ Swagger UI will work from both HTTP and HTTPS origins
- ‚úÖ All API endpoints will be accessible from any origin

## üö® Important Notes

1. **Deploy First**: The CORS errors won't disappear until you deploy the new version
2. **Restart Required**: You must restart your application after deploying the new JAR
3. **Test Both**: Verify that both HTTP and HTTPS work after deployment
4. **Monitor Logs**: Check application logs for any CORS-related errors
